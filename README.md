# HBNB

## Introduction
HBNB is a minimalist Airbnb-like platform that allows users to list and explore rental properties. Currently, it does not include a payment system or booking functionality, but it will provide a solid foundation for managing places, users, and related data.  
Project is still under development, but feel free to take a look at our files !
