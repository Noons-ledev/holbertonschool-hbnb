# HBNB

## Introduction
HBNB is a minimalist Airbnb-like platform that allows users to list and explore rental properties. Currently, it does not include a payment system or booking functionality, but it will provide a solid foundation for managing places, users, and related data.  

This document outlines the UML diagrams used in the project's conception, explaining their significance and how they shape the architecture of HBNB.

## üìå Comprehensive Technical Document

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Introduction**
**Overview:**  
This document serves as a technical reference for the HBNB project, detailing its architectural design, business logic, and API interaction flow. It ensures clarity and consistency in implementation and provides guidance for future development.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **High-Level Architecture**

### High-Level Architecture  

The **High-Level Package Diagram** of HBNB represents the architecture in **three main layers**:  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation Layer (Services, API)  
- Manages interaction with users through controllers and API services.  
- Validates and forwards requests to the business logic layer via a **facade**.  

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Business Logic Layer (Models & Logic)  
- Contains the **core models** of the project (`User`, `Place`, `Review`, `Amenity`).  
- Implements **business logic** (entity management and validation).  
- Uses the **Facade Pattern** to centralize service access.  

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Persistence Layer (Database & Repositories)  
- Responsible for **data management and persistence**.  
- Provides **repositories** to interact with the database.  

#### üîÑ Communication Between Layers  
- **Requests always go through the facade** to prevent direct coupling between presentation and persistence.  
- The architecture promotes **modularity**, **scalability**, and **better maintainability** of the code.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£Class Diagram  

The **Class Diagram** of our HBNB project represents the **core entities** and their relationships, ensuring a clear **object-oriented structure** for managing users, places, reviews, and amenities.  

### üìå **Main Classes & Inheritance**  
- **`BaseModel`** (Abstract Class)  
  - Serves as a **parent class** for all other models, providing common attributes (`id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) and generic methods (`delete()`, `update()`).  

- **`User`**  
  - Represents a platform user, storing **personal details** (`first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `password`).  
  - Implements authentication (`set_password()`, `check_password()`, `sign_up()`, `login()`).  
  - Users can **write reviews** and **own places**.  

- **`Place`**  
  - Represents a rental property with details like **name, location, price, currency, and average rating**.  
  - Each place is **owned by a user** (`owner_id`).  
  - Supports amenities (`add_amenity()`, `remove_amenity()`).  

- **`Review`**  
  - Allows users to leave a **rating and comment** on a place.  
  - Connected to both a `User` (who writes the review) and a `Place` (being reviewed).  

- **`Amenity`**  
  - Represents an individual amenity (e.g., Wi-Fi, Pool).  
  - Can be **linked to multiple places** through `AmenityPlace`.  

#### üîÑ **Relationships Between Classes**  
- **Inheritance (`<|--`)**  
  - `User`, `Place`, `Review`, and `Amenity` all **inherit from `BaseModel`**, ensuring common functionalities.  

- **Associations (`-->`, `*--`)**  
  - A `User` **owns multiple places** (`1 *-- many`).  
  - A `User` **writes multiple reviews** (`1 --> many`).  
  - A `Place` **has multiple reviews** (`1 *-- many`).  
  - `Place` and `Amenity` share a **many-to-many** relationship, managed via `AmenityPlace`.  

This class diagram provides a **structured representation** of the core objects in HBNB, ensuring clear **data management and modularity** for future implementations:

## 3Ô∏è‚É£API Calls & Sequence Diagrams  

The HBNB project follows a structured API interaction model, ensuring clear communication between the **Presentation Layer (API Services)**, **Business Logic Layer**, and **Persistence Layer (Database)**. Below are key sequence diagrams illustrating different API calls and their execution flow.  

---

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Registration  

This sequence diagram shows the steps involved when a user tries to create an account. The system validates the input, hashes the password, and stores the user data in the database.  
We've added some edge cases that could be expected.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogic
    participant Persistence

    User->>API: Send registration data (name, email, password)
    API->>BusinessLogic: Validate input data (email, password)

    alt Valid input
        BusinessLogic->>BusinessLogic: Hash password (if needed)
        BusinessLogic->>Persistence: Save user data to database
        Persistence->>BusinessLogic: Confirm user saved
        BusinessLogic->>API: Return success
        API->>User: HTTP 201 - User created successfully
        
    else Database error (HTTP 500)
        Persistence->>API: Return error (HTTP 500 - Database failure)
        API->>User: HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error
       
    else Invalid input (missing password or existing email)
        BusinessLogic->>BusinessLogic: Detects Invalid input
        BusinessLogic->>API: Return error (password required)
        API->>User: HTTP 400 + Error message
    end
  ```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a New Place
This sequence represents the API flow when a user creates a new place listing. The request is validated, processed, and stored in the database if successful.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogicLayer
    participant PersistenceLayer

    User->>API: POST /places (title, description, price, lat, long, photos, amenities)
    API->>BusinessLogicLayer: validateRequest (data)
    BusinessLogicLayer->>PersistenceLayer: createPlace (data)

    alt Insert Success
        PersistenceLayer-->>BusinessLogicLayer: return new Place (id)
        BusinessLogicLayer-->>API: return Response (201, place)
        API-->>User: Response (201 Created) JSON (place)

    else Missing required fields (photos, amenities, etc.)
        BusinessLogicLayer ->> BusinessLogicLayer: Detects invalid input
        BusinessLogicLayer-->>API: return Response (400, "Missing required fields")
        API-->>User: Response (400 Bad Request) JSON (error)

    else Insert Failed
        PersistenceLayer-->>BusinessLogicLayer: return Response (500, "Database Error")
        BusinessLogicLayer-->>API: return Response (500, "Database Error")
        API-->>User: Response (500 Internal Server Error) JSON (error)
    end
```
#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Submitting a Review
This sequence details how a user submits a review for a place, ensuring the user exists, storing the review, and handling potential errors.


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogic
    participant Database

    %% New Review Submission
    User ->> API: POST /reviews (rating, comment, place_id)
    API ->> BusinessLogic: Validate input
    alt Valid Data
        BusinessLogic ->> Database: Check if user exists
        Database -->> BusinessLogic: User verified
        BusinessLogic ->> Database: Insert review (user_id, place_id, rating, comment)
        Database -->> BusinessLogic: Review saved
        BusinessLogic -->> API: Return success (201 Created)
        API -->> User: 201 Created (Review submitted)
    else Invalid Data
        BusinessLogic -->> API: Return error (400 Bad Request)
        API -->> User: 400 Bad Request (Invalid review data)
    else Database error
        Database -->> BusinessLogic: Error Occurs
        BusinessLogic -->> API: Return HTTP 500 Status code
        API -->> User: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
    end

    %% Fetching an Existing Review
    User ->> API: GET /reviews/{review_id}
    API ->> BusinessLogic: Fetch review
    BusinessLogic ->> Database: Get review by ID
    Database -->> BusinessLogic: Return review details
    BusinessLogic -->> API: Send review details
    API -->> User: 200 OK (Review data)
    
    alt Review Not Found
        Database -->> BusinessLogic: Review does not exist
        BusinessLogic -->> API: Return error (404 Not Found)
        API -->> User: 404 Not Found (Review does not exist)
    end
```
#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fetching a List of Places
This sequence describes the process when a user requests a list of places.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User ->> API: HTTP Request "GET" to fetch a list of places
    API ->> BusinessLogic: Receiving request, processing it, and calling BusinessLogic
    alt Valid Input
